    <h1>Lunar Eclipse</h1>
    <p>A lunar eclipse occurs when the Moon moves into the Earth's shadow. This can occur only when the Sun, Earth, and
        Moon are exactly or very closely aligned (in syzygy) with Earth between the other two, and only on the night of
        a full moon. The type and length of a lunar eclipse depend on the Moon's proximity to either node of its orbit.
    </p>
    <p>A totally eclipsed Moon is sometimes called a blood moon for its reddish color, which is caused by Earth
        completely
        blocking direct sunlight from reaching the Moon. The only light reflected from the lunar surface has been
        refracted by
        Earth's atmosphere. This light appears reddish for the same reason that a sunset or sunrise does: the Rayleigh
        scattering of bluer light.
    </p>
